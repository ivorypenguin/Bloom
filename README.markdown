#BLOOM!


###First Attempt at a particle engine and some swarm dynamics in JavaScript
* Particles "work"
* There's some really stupid swarm dynamics...
* I need more comments
* don't be scared by all the files... the only one that needs to be edited is js/script.js

###Particle Engine
* Real simple Particle engine
* Phytoplankton are just little dots right now
* they live for a random time < 250
* when they die they instantly are reincarnated at a random location

###Swarm Dynamics
* Currently our particles are really, really stupid
* There's a leader that gets a random location
* All the other particles move towards the leader
